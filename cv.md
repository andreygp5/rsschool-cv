## About me

My goal is to become a *Front-end developer*. My priorities are as follows: studying and practicing JS, HTML, CSS. Besides that I'm basketball player in University team, which keeps me mentally and psychologically fit.

I feel myself quick enough in mastering new skills, judging by my progress in basketball or english.

## Stack of technologies

* JS
* HTML/CSS
* BEM
* GIT
* Flask
* SQL

## Code examples

```js
function countCats(arr) {
  let catCounter = 0;
  for (let subArr of arr) {
    for (let value of subArr) {
      if (value === "^^") {
        catCounter++;
      }
    }
  }
  return catCounter;
};
```
