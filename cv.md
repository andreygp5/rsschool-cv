## About me

My goal is to become a *Front-end developer*. My priorities are as follows: studying and practicing JS, HTML, CSS. Besides that I'm basketball player in University team, which keeps me mentally and psychologically fit.

I'm quick enough in mastering new skills, judging by my progress in basketball or english.

## Stack of technologies

* JS
* HTML/CSS
* BEM
* GIT
* Flask
* SQL

## Code examples

```js
function countCats(arr) {
  let catCounter = 0;
  for (let subArr of arr) {
    for (let value of subArr) {
      if (value === "^^") {
        catCounter++;
      }
    }
  }
  return catCounter;
};
```
