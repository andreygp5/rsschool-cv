## About me

My goal is to become a Front-end developer. My priorities are as follows: studying and practicing JS, HTML, CSS. Besides that I'm basketball player in University team, which keeps me mentally and psychologically fit.

I feel myself quick enough in mastering new skills, judging by my progress in basketball or english.
